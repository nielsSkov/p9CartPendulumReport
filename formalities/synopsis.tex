The aim of the project was to investigate a method for trajectory planning for a cart pendulum. To find an interesting trajectory, a task was posed for the system to complete.\\
The system was modeled and a simulation of the system dynamics created using MATLAB Simulink. To aid in the progress and to be able to show the result in a visual manner a graphical layer was added to the simulation.\\
The properties of the system was assessed using phase portraits. It was found that the phase portrait can be altered making different trajectories possible by designing the input force as a solution to the integral of the system dynamics given some initial conditions and constraints.
