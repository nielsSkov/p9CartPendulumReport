\chapter{Nonlinear Control}
The control objective is to stabilize the pendulum at $\theta = 0$. To achieve this objective a sliding mode controller is designed for the cart pendulum system. To do so the system is transformed into a \textit{regular form} presented in this chapter along with the sliding mode design.
