\section{Problem Description}\label{sec:problemDescription}
The system in \autoref{fig:system}, is the well-known cart pendulum system. The system can only be controlled by a the force shown directly on the cart in the horisontal direction. So the system is underactuated, and nonlinear.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{The cart pendulum system with generalized coordinates, $x$ and $\theta$, where $x$ is the center of the cart, $\theta$ is the angle of the pendulum, $m$ is the point mass of the pendulum, $M$ is the mass of the cart, g is the gravitational acceleration and f is the force of actuation.}

The system is presented with a specific task, see \autoref{fig:systemTask}. This aids in understanding the convinience of the presented trajectory planning tools, as the task requires nonlinear operation, where linearization alone is not enough.
