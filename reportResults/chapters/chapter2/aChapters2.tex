\chapter{Trajectory Planning}
In this chapter, the problem posed in \autoref{sec:problemDescription}, \autoref{fig:systemTask}, is broken down into successive tasks. Each of these tasks are then analyzed to find feasible trajectories. These trajectories are finally realized and concatenated to finally accomplish the posed problem of obstacle avoidance.
